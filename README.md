# WebTechnologies2024

### This project was created for our second year of University, faculty of Computer Science. 

### We developed a web application that manages the culinary preferences of an individual or group of people. The application also supports the management of associated (meta-)data, such as category, price, ingredients, images, and more. The system supports activities for creating shopping lists and managing users. It generates various statistics that can be exported in open formats.

### A more detailed description of the project can be found in the technical report.
