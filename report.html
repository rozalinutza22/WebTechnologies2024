          <p>
            This web application allows two types of users, admin and customer. The admin user can access and modify the database by adding/removing recipes,
            recommendations, pieces of information about each recipe, their availability and expiration date. The customer can only view and buy the products 
            that are available and can modify its profile. </p>
          <p>Each type of user must create an account by providing personal information as first name,
            last name, email adress and phone number. After registration, the user must complete the login form to have access to its profile. </p>
        </section>

        <section id="assumptions">
          <h3>

          <p>
            A constraint that appears in our create account form is that first name, last name, email adress and phone number are required.
            Otherwise, the user can not create an account. Also, there are specific types of phone numbers that are allows to use in the create account form.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is very important for the user to inform us about every allergens that he/she is allergic to, because we can not apply the filtering process
            if we do not know which product should be avoided. The same case is for the vegeterian diet, the user should mark the checkbox that we have placed 
            in the create account form and in the modify account form.
