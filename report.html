            It is very important for the user to inform us about every allergens that he/she is allergic to, because we can not apply the filtering process
            if we do not know which product should be avoided. The same case is for the vegeterian diet, the user should mark the checkbox that we have placed 
            in the create account form and in the modify account form.
