          <ul>
            <li>Users can create an account by introducing information like first name, last name, email address, phone number and creating a password. They can set if they are vegetarian or not, introduce allergens, and set if they are admin or not.</li>
            <li>After account creation, users will be redirected to the menu page. Here products are grouped in categories that can be filtered. Besides this, search for a specific product name is possible.</li>
            <li>On menu page, users can also order the products by perishability, name or price.</li>
            <li>Every product display has three specific buttons: one for showing more details, that will redirect the user to the product page, one for adding the product to another user's specific list and another one for adding the product to the favourites list.</li>
            <li>The navigation bar has three options: menu page, lists page and one for user's profile.</li>
            <li>In the lists page, the user has his own favourites list predefined. He can also create more lists by introducting the desired name in the text input area and click on the "add list" button.</li>
            <li>In every list, if any products are added their name and price are displayed, and the total price of the items. Also, every product has a remove button on the left, if the user changes his mind and wants to remove an item.</li>
            <li>On lists page, the user can find a section called "Other things you might like". Here, four products are displayed in the following manner:</li>
            <p>If the user has never added an item to a list or clicked on the product to see more details about it, the section will show four random products.</p>
            <p>But, if the user has added a product to a list or clicked on the button to view its details, it will be saved in a "preferences" table. If the product is present in one of the lists, it will not be shown again in the other section. Otherwise, it will be present there. One of three products are chosen from the preferences table, and the other one is always chosen random.</p>
            <li>On the lists page, the user can export his statistics in csv, json or pdf format. The statistics are based on his preferences, and are focused on the product categories.</li>
            <li>On profile page, the user can view his information introduced at create account. He can export this data in csv or json format.</li>
            <li>The user can modify his information by clicking the modify button, or by importing a csv or json file, that must be in the document format of export.</li>
            <li>Other options available to every user on profile page is logout and delete account.</li>
            <li>If the user is admin, he can acces the admin page via a button from profile. In the admin page, he can:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Delete all users</li>
              <li>Create a new user's account</li>

          <p>
            This web application allows two types of users, admin and customer. The admin user can access and modify the database by adding/removin 
            users and lists. The customer can only view and add the products that are available to the lists and can modify its profile. </p>
            <p>In order to become an admin, the user has to check the admin checkbox that is provided in the registration form. Otherwise, the user
              will not have admin rights.
            </p>
          <p>Every user has its own recommendations based on its favorites products.</p>
          <p>Each type of user must create an account by providing personal information as first name,
            last name, email adress and phone number. After registration, the user must complete the login form to have access to its profile. </p>

            The user is strongly advised to keep their login information private. Any loss of data can influence its future experience
            within our application.

          <p>
            If you suspect that someone stole your login credentials, please contact us.

            Our application uses prepared statements for all SQL queries involving user-provided data. This is the best method to prevent 
            SQL injection attacks. Essentially, prepared statements separate SQL code from user data, ensuring that the data is 
            always treated as simple values and not as part of the SQL code.
